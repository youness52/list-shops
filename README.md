# list-shops
hello,
for this coding challenge i used framework PHP.
but i didn't use data fron bson file, i used MySQL (phpmyadmin).you will find file SQL in the ZIP in DataBase folder, i used Xampp V3.2.2 
and phpmyadmin Version information: 4.8.4. the dataBase name is : shops. there is some data in it.
I think i did all the requered function like as in readme coding challenge requirements, and i included al optional items (bonus).in actually i can do more than that. all this work i did it in one day and i focused on important things,so you will find a fille index.php and css folder and js folder and fonts folder and images folder in united-remote.ZIP. if any thing missing please contact me.
i hope i get your reply soon.
best regards and thanks,
